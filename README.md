A simple CLI app with a web scraper. 

This app basically goes through the [Stardew Valley's List of All Gifts](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/List_of_All_Gifts) page, gets the data from the table found in that page, and creates a JSON file containing all of the gathered data.

This project also serves as *my* practice for **Golang**. 

This is part of a larger web project which can be found [here](https://github.com/janellamarie/stardew-gift-finder-web).
